                <p>My interest with technology and software began during childhood with the introduction to my familys Pentium III computer.
                    Gaming took precedence, continuing on into my teen years, focusing on playing with software rather than crafting it.
                    After some time away from school and in the culinary industry, I desired to challenge myself by digging deeper into the tools and technologies I'd been using for years.
                    This led me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, refining my skills and understanding of software engineering and design.
